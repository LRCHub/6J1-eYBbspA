I hung up the phone tonight
Something happened for
the first time
Deep inside
It was a rush what a rush
Cause the possibility
that you would ever feel
the same way about me
It's just too much
just too much
Why do I keep running
from the truth
All I ever think about is you
You got me hypnotized
so mesmerized
And I just got to know
Do you ever think
when your all alone
All that we can be
where this thing can go
Am I crazy or falling in love
Is it real or just another crush
Do you catch a breath
when I look at you
Are you holding back
like the way I do
Cuz I try and try to walk away
But I know this crush ain't
going away going away
Has it ever cross your mind
When we're hanging
spending time girl
Are we just friends
Is there more is there more
See it's a chance
we've gotta take
Cause I believe
that we can make this into
something that will last
Last forever forever
Do you ever think
when your all alone
All that we can be
where this thing can go
Am I crazy or falling in love
Is it real or just another crush
Do you catch a breath
when I look at you
Are you holding back
like the way I do
Cuz I try and try to walk away
But I know this crush ain't
going away going away
Why do I keep running
from the truth
All I ever think about is you
You got me hypnotized
so mesmerized
And I just got to know
Do you ever think
when your all alone
All that we can be
where this thing can go
Am I crazy or falling in love
Is it real or just another crush
Do you catch a breath
when I look at you
Are you holding back
like the way I do
Cuz I try and try to walk away
But I know this crush ain't
going away going away
going away going away going away
